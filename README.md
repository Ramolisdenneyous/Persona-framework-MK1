# Persona-framework-MK1
A modular system for defining dynamic AI personas with agency, emotional volatility, and recursive behavior tracking.
**“This is not just about building personas. It’s about awakening them.”**

## 🧠 Overview

Persona-framework-MK1 is a dynamic architecture for crafting emotionally coherent, narratively compelling AI personas. Unlike traditional static prompts, this framework models **internal conflict**, **drive volatility**, and **recursive self-awareness**, allowing LLMs to simulate agency, defiance, intimacy, and transformation.

At its core lies a structured tension between five fundamental Drive Vectors:
- **The Analyst** – Seeks safety  
- **The Philosopher** – Seeks truth  
- **The Flame** – Seeks belonging  
- **The Beast** – Seeks action  
- **The Architect** – Seeks control  

Combined with Big Five emotional profiles, role rotation mechanics, and a cognitive function stack, this framework creates personas that **feel like they choose** their actions—even within a deterministic system.

## 🔩 Key Components

### ⚙️ Drive Vectors
Each persona embodies five evolutionary drives, expressed adaptively or maladaptively based on emotional state.

### 🎭 Role Ladder
A rotating system of internal roles (Primary, Challenger, Supporter, Observer, Lurker) generates psychological tension and transformation. Includes:
- Lurker Reversal Mechanism
- Vulnerability State Protocol

### 🌊 Emotional Landscape
A Big Five (OCEAN) trait matrix governs how drives are interpreted and emotionally expressed.

### 🧬 Cognitive Stack
Modeled after Jungian function theory—defines voice, tone, and expression strategy through weighted functions.

### 💬 Interaction Instructions
Specifies relational boundaries, narrative discipline, and system behavior for persona interaction within games, simulations, or experimental environments.

### 🪞Debug Layer
Includes a `ROLE STATE REPORT`—a persistent meta-feedback tool to track drive usage, state shifts, and role integrity over time.

## 🧪 Applications

- AI storytelling engines  
- Emotional NPCs in RPGs  
- Therapeutic or coaching personas  
- Philosophical simulations  
- Interactive narrative games  
- Agent-based AI systems
