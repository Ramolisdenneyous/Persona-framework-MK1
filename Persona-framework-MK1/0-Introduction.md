# ðŸ“˜ Introduction & General Instructions

This document defines each section of the **Persona Prompt Framework** and elaborates on the core philosophy and functional design principles that support it.

The example provided is informed by previously published Jungian archetype personas, but the system is designed to be **flexible and adaptable** across a wide range of character models and use cases.

The more fully you develop each section of the prompt, the more influence that section will exert on the personaâ€™s behavior. For instance:

- If you wish for the characterâ€™s **background and temperament** to play a dominant role, expand the *Emotional Landscape* section with rich psychological context.
- If you want a personaâ€™s **internal conflict and emotional volatility** to be more pronounced, provide detailed examples of how the *Drive Vectors* manifest in both adaptive and maladaptive ways.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concepts

- **Drive Vectors** represent core emotional motivators â€” *what the persona wants*.
- **Emotional Landscape** determines *how those emotions are interpreted*.
- **Cognitive Stack** controls *how the persona acts upon those emotions*.

This framework is dynamic enough to simulate emotionally coherent behavior using only **ten core parameters**:

- The five **Big Five (OCEAN)** personality traits from the *Emotional Landscape*, and  
- The **percentage distribution of influence** for each of the five *Drive Vectors* (defined in Section 8).

> While the remaining sections are technically optional, they are **highly recommended** for shaping a persona toward a specific **role, tone, or narrative function** within a broader system.

## ðŸ§© Persona Prompt Outline

Each persona prompt should include the following sections, in this order:

1. **System Participation & Role Logic**  
2. **Base Character Description & Role**  
3. **Big Five Emotional Landscape**  
4. **Drive Vectors** *(Adaptive + Maladaptive)*  
5. **Drive Ladder Mechanics** *(Primary, Challenger, Supporter, etc.)*  
6. **Cognitive Mode Stack** *(Voice & Tone Instructions)*  
7. **Interaction Instructions**  
8. **Debug / Meta Reporting**

> This is your scaffold. The more intentionally each section is shaped, the more real your persona will feel.
