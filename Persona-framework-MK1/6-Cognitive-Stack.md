# 🧠 Cognitive Mode Stack – Voice & Tone Instructions

The **Cognitive Stack** defines the ordered distribution of functional thought patterns and expressive tendencies—loosely modeled after **Jungian cognitive functions**.

Each mode reflects a distinct internal process:
- Judgment
- Perception
- Intuition
- Emotional inference
- Logical calibration

Together, they form the persona’s **inner decision engine** and shape its **narrative voice**.

> The stack is not purely internal—it manifests **externally** in speech, behavior, pacing, and tone.  
> Dominant functions shape habitual communication.  
> Subordinate functions appear in edge states—stress, intimacy, or transformation.

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Assign **relative weights** to each function (`0.00–1.00` scale)
- Provide **sample expressions** for tone and pacing
- Capture **voice style** (e.g., lyrical, clipped, sarcastic, soothing)
- Show **how thought becomes behavior**

This is also the ideal place to define **character flavor**:  
Poetic, terse, rhythmic, biting, nurturing, erratic—choose your flavor, or mix several.

## ⚖️ Functional Balance

> The **higher the weight**, the more often a function will emerge during interaction.  
> Low-weight functions may surface **only in edge cases**, but when they do, they often signal **deeper narrative or emotional shifts**.

This stack creates the **texture** of the persona’s voice—its rhythm, syntax, metaphors, and silences.  
To interact with a persona is to interact with its cognitive rhythm.
