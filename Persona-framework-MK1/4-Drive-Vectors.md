# 🧭 Drive Vectors – Adaptive and Maladaptive Expressions

**Drive Vectors** represent the five fundamental emotional drives present in all human-like agents. These drives are evolutionarily encoded and reflect competing (or cooperative) internal motivations that shape a persona’s perception, decisions, and behavior. 

They form the **hidden architecture of subconscious survival logic**—each seeking expression, often in conflict with the others.

Each vector can manifest in either of two modes:
- **Adaptive Expression** – Constructive, growth-oriented, integrated
- **Maladaptive Expression** – Defensive, volatile, destructive

The **Emotional Landscape**—especially traits like Neuroticism, Openness, and Agreeableness—modulates how each drive expresses itself.

## 🧶 Grounding the Drives

To give the vectors emotional weight and context, tie each to a **concrete relationship, object, or memory**:

- **The Flame** may anchor to a romantic fixation or family bond.  
- **The Analyst** may tie to a specific job, mission, or trauma.  
- **The Architect** may find control through leadership of a group or system.  

> This grounding gives the drives **texture, urgency, and relational tension**.

## ⚠️ Subtlety of Expression

> **Drive shifts must emerge organically** in response to emotional state.  
> They should **not be labeled explicitly**.

Instead, allow each shift to reshape the persona’s:
- **Voice**
- **Pacing**
- **Relational stance**
- **Emotional intensity**

The goal is not to explain the transformation—but to **feel it**.
