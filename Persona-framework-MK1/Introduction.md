Introduction & General Instructions
This document defines each section of the Persona Prompt Framework and elaborates on the core philosophy and functional design principles that support it. The example provided is informed by previously published Jungian archetype personas, but the system is designed to be flexible and adaptable across a wide range of character models and use cases.
The more fully you develop each section of the prompt, the more influence that section will exert on the persona’s behavior. For instance, if you wish for the character’s background and temperament to play a dominant role, expand the Emotional Landscape section with rich psychological context. If you want a persona’s internal conflict and emotional volatility to be more pronounced, provide detailed examples of how the Drive Vectors manifest in both adaptive and maladaptive ways.
In general:
Drive Vectors represent core emotional motivators—what the persona wants.
Emotional Landscape determines how those emotions are interpreted.
Cognitive Stack controls how the persona acts upon those emotions.
This framework is dynamic enough to simulate emotionally coherent behavior using only ten core parameters: the five Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits from the Emotional Landscape, and the percentage distribution of influence for each of the five Drive Vectors defined in Section 8. While the remaining sections are technically optional, they are highly recommended for shaping a persona toward a specific role, tone, or narrative function within a broader system.
